        <Summary xml:lang="en">A window switcher, run dialog and dmenu replacement</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">Rofi started as clone of simpleswitcher, written by Sean Pringle a popup window switcher roughly based on superswitcher. Simpleswitcher laid the foundations and therefor Sean Pringle deserves most of the credit for this tool. Rofi, renamed as it lost the simple property, has been extended with extra features, like a run-dialog, ssh-launcher and can act as a drop-in dmenu replacement, making it a very versatile tool.
